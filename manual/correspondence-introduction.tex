\chapter{Introduction}

This is the manual for the \CONTEXT||correspondence manual.

The module was written at the start as a package to write letters with a consistent
and use to use interface and a few options to change the layout in a consistent way.

The core for the first version was based on the letter manual from Hans Hagen
(\filename{m-letter.tex}) and parts of this still remain in the low level code of
the module.

As the time past more and more parts had been added to the package and it ended up
in a similar interface as the \LaTeX-classes but with its own commands to set user
values. Because of its origin in Hansâ€™ module the user interface and the low level
parts are split in two different files and many more interfaces for users are
possible, one of them tries to mimic the style of Hans module.

As the time past the author wrote a generic version of the complete setup commands
and a few other in the letter core and created the new file \filename{t-correspondence.tex}
which holds now the low level code. As a result of this the new file
\filename{t-resume.tex} became part of the package with its own setup commands
and external style and interface files.
