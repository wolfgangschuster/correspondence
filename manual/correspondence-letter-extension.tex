\chapter{Extensions}

The letter module provides a special type of files, called extensions.
They provide functions that could be used by different files like the
labels for each language (\filename{label.nle}) or extra features for
one purpose like the page optimation (\filename{optimize.nle}).

You can load extension files either with the letter module and write
their names as argument to the \type{extension} key or afterwards in
your file with the \type{\useletterextension} command.

\setup[useletterextension]

The module comes itself with the following extensions:
